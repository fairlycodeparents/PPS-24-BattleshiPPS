# BattleshiPPS üó∫Ô∏è

This project is an implementation of the classic board game Battleship, developed for the Paradigms of Programming and Development course. The project is divided into two main phases: ship placement and the attack phase, where players compete to sink each other's fleet.

The goal is to create a complete gaming experience with an intuitive graphical user interface, supporting various configurations and game modes.

For more in-depth information about the project's design and features, you can read the [project documentation](https://fairlycodeparents.github.io/PPS-24-BattleshiPPS/).

### Features

-   **Game Rules**: You can choose the number of ships per type and the game mode (multiplayer on the same device or against a bot).
-   **Ship Placement**: Ships can be placed on the grid either manually or randomly.
-   **Game Logic**: The system autonomously manages turns, target selection, checking for victory conditions, and determining the winner.
-   **Testing**: The project includes tests to ensure the correctness of the logic. A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is used to simplify and improve the readability of these tests.

### Optional Requirements

- [x]   **Bot Difficulty**: You can select different difficulty levels for the computer-controlled opponent.
- [x]   **Special Attacks**: Special attacks, such as area-of-effect strikes, have been added.
- [ ]   **Obstacles**: The map can contain obstacles that influence ship placement, adding a strategic element.
